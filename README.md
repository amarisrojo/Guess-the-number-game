# Guess-the-number-game
A game that allows the user to guess a random number from 1-1000 within 10 guesses and displays the winning/losing results.

Things I learned from this project
* Define and call functions
* Pass arguments through functions
* Import random
* Run a while, for, if...elif..else loop
